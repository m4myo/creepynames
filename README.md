//well, facebook stopped letting scripts without access_key to crawl data from their pages

I was making a self-storywriting program.
I need to collect names, genders, materials, plots, emotions for this project and put them together to make storylines.
I don't need too many names though, but I wanna get the names and genders get right together. So, I decided to take from Facebook and do some machine learning along with other requirements for the story.
